### Key Use Cases of Rive at Brilliant
1. **Color-Coded Learning Pathways**  
   - Brilliant uses Rive to build the visual structure of their learning paths, including nodes and connecting lines.  
   - Each path is color-coded based on the learning topic (e.g., math, data science), with animations created in multiple color variants and node types.  
   - Rive’s flexibility allows Brilliant to manage this complexity efficiently, which would have been impractical with their previous tools due to the sheer number of variations required.

2. **Streak Feature**  
   - The streak feature tracks consecutive days a user has actively learned on the platform, and Rive powers its animation.  
   - Using Rive’s Event triggers, the animation syncs seamlessly with the increasing streak count, tying the visual feedback directly to user actions.  
   - This creates a satisfying, rewarding experience that reinforces daily learning habits.
